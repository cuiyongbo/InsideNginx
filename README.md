# Inside Nginx

Notes about NGINX source code, which consist of 5 chapters:

- Data structure
- Memory management
- Signal processing
- Event cycle
- Load balance

Refer to `notes` directory for futher details and html documentation can be build using `sphinx`.

And I also put the refered source files in `nginx_src` for convenience.
